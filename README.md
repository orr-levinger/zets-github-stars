# Zets Github Starts 

### Architecture choices
As discussed in the zoom I made it "My Own" So I can showcase my way of thinking and how I would approach this kind of task. 
* serverless framework as my IaC to be able to update and redeploy changes easily.
* Lambda for scalability and simplicity (Not having to manage Containers lifecycle)
* API Gateway
  * Fully managed makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor
  * Secure APIs at any scale.
  * Input schema validation capabilities.
* Cognito and Amplify for authentication and authorisation
  * Offers user interface
  * Scalability and Security
  * Simple Integration with AWS Services
* S3 as the static website hosting
  * Cost-Effective Hosting
  * High Scalability and Availability
  * Easy Deployment and Maintenance
  * Simple to Update
* For CI/CD i am using GitHub actions
  * to streamline the deployment process so the BE and FE are updated automatically on every 'master' push.

### Gaps
* Static website hosting in s3
  * currently it uses http protocol and not https. I would have set certificate to make it https
* React:
  * The code could be much cleaner and be split into smaller components and files.
  * Could have used a modern state management and lifecycle tool like redux or react-query.
  * Nicer layout with proper CSS
  * Fetching by clicking the next page and not the NEXT button.

### Fork the Repository
To run this project in your own AWS account, you should first fork this repository:

1. Navigate to the original repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the page.

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account
- GitHub Account

## Setting up a Development Environment in GitHub

To deploy and run the application in your own environment, you need to create a development environment in your forked GitHub repository and set up the required secrets.

### Setup Environment Variables in GitHub
1. In your GitHub repository, navigate to the "Settings" tab.
2. On the left sidebar, click on "Environments".
3. Click on "New environment" to create a new environment.
4. Name the environment "dev" (or another name, but make sure it matches the environment name used in the GitHub Actions workflow).
5. Click on "Configure environment".

- **`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`**
    - **Description**: AWS IAM user access key ID with necessary permissions.
    - **Type**: String
    - **Required**: Yes

- **`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`**
    - **Description**: AWS IAM user secret access key.
    - **Type**: Secret
    - **Required**: Yes

- **`WEBAPP_BUCKET`**
    - **Description**: The name of the S3 bucket where the frontend will be deployed. (Must be unique)
    - **Type**: String
    - **Required**: Yes

### Creating a Secured Variable in AWS
Create a secured variable in your AWS account called `zets-github-token` with your GitHub API token (In the same region as the stack).

1. Navigate to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the service that manages your secured variables (e.g., AWS SSM).
3. Create a new secret with the key `zets-github-token` and set your GitHub token as the value.

### Deploying the Application
The application is deployed using GitHub Actions. The workflow is triggered on any push to the master branch or can be manually dispatched:

1. Push changes to the master branch or go to the 'Actions' tab in your GitHub repository.
2. Select the 'Deploy Dev' workflow.
3. Click 'Run workflow' to manually dispatch the workflow.
4. The endpoit to access the APP will be under http://{WEBAPP_BUCKET}-dev.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
